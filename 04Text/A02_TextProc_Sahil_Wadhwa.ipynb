    "## Project examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1) perform the analysis of data/ira.csv (similarly to what done in text_processing_intro.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) perform sentiment analysis on this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "3) detail comments, explain step by step what is happening, and try to write down a paragraph or two at the end discussing what you figured out\n",
    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Choose a short list of famous people (at least 2) that you want to compare and look for their Wikipedia page, e.g., \n",
    "urls = []\n",
    "urls.append(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James\")\n",
    "urls.append(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan\")\n",
    "urls.append(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2) think about an interesting question you can answer. E.g., \n",
    "- in which of the three pages the word \"record\" appears more often? (we know how to search!)\n",
    "- which is the most positive page? (we know how to do sentiment analysis!)\n",
    "- in which year was each player born? (more complicated, but we can do it)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) make sure you can web scrape each page\n",
    "\n",
    "4) write the code to web scrape and do your analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "5) prepare 1 (one) .ipynb , in which you have code, results and (most importantly) you describe what you are looking for and how you do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "#### Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "1) check the books you like from https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top\n",
    "\n",
    "2) you have an example in data/book1.txt ; choose 1 book (or a few of them)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) think about an interesting question you can answer. E.g., \n",
    "- which are the most common words? (we know how to do it!)\n",
    "- is there a particular word you have in mind? (easy to check)\n",
    "- how many different words do we have?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) can we download it automatically or better to do it manually? *CHECK BEFORE DOING IT!*\n",
    "- in case we can not do it automatically, let's respect it! we can download them manually and save them\n",
    "- get a quick look at http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Terms_of_Use also!\n",
    "\n",
    "5) let's analyze the book, we have all the tools from the notebooks processing_text and RegularExpressions! \n"

      "Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player.  As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), two-time NBA Finals MVP winner. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[3][4][5][6] he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryant was the son of former NBA player Joe Bryant. He attended Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania, where he was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the country. Upon graduation, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault by a 19-year-old hotel clerk.[7] Criminal charges were brought and then dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a civil suit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge, but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single game in league history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon at age 34. Although he recovered from that injury, he suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing his physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015–16 season.\n",

      "Bryant is the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. He was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four All-Star MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname \"Black Mamba\" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for his 2017 film Dear Basketball.[8]\n",

      "Bryant was born in Philadelphia,[10] the youngest of three children and only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John \"Chubby\" Cox.[11] His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu.[12][13] His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's nickname \"Jellybean.\"[14] Bryant's family was Catholic and he had always practiced his faith.[15][16][17][18]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryant started playing basketball when he was three,[19] and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up.[20] When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball at a lower level.[21][22] After two years, they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian.[23] He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, which he considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made.[24][25] Bryant began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia.[26][27] Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study.[28] Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports, from which he learned more about basketball.[29] He also learned to play soccer and his favorite soccer team was A.C. Milan.[30][31] During summers, Bryant would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league.[32] When Bryant was 13, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cywynd Middle School.[23][33]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman.[34] Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record.[34][35] The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions.[34] During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals[36] and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination,[37][38] attracting attention from college recruiters in the process.[37] Duke, Michigan, North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list. However, after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros.[37]\n",
      "\n",
      "At Adidas ABCD Camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award[39] while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom.[40] While in high school, then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team, where he played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse.[41] In his senior year of high school, Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots in leading the Aces to a 31–3 record.[42] Bryant ended his high school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time leading scorer at 2,883 points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryant received several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. These included being named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, a first-team Parade All-American and a USA Today All-USA First Team player.[44][45] Bryant's varsity coach, Greg Downer, commented that he was \"a complete player who dominates\" and praised his work ethic, even as the team's top player.[42][46] In 1996, Bryant took R&B singer Brandy to his senior prom.[47] Ultimately, the 17-year-old Bryant made the decision to go directly into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so.[34] Bryant's news was met with a lot of publicity at a time when prep-to-pro NBA players were not very common (Garnett being the only exception in 20 years).[34] His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission to any college he chose,[12][48] but he did not officially visit any campuses.[46] In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[49]\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker manager Jerry West, \"marched over these people\".[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player's draft rights to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille O'Neal. Bill Branch, the Charlotte Hornets' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made.[51] Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles. However, on June 30, Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996, when the league's off-season moratorium ended.[52] Since Bryant was still 17 at the time, his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until he was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began.[53] Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling $3.5 million.[54]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris.[55] He scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games.[56] As a rookie in 1996–97, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel.[57] At the time he became the youngest player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days; a record since broken by Jermaine O'Neal and former teammate Andrew Bynum), and also became the youngest NBA starter (18 years, 158 days).[58][59] Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of the season, he averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the All-Star weekend, Bryant participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest dunk champion at the age of 18.[60] Bryant's performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight.[61]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5. Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist, Robert Horry was ejected for fighting with Utah's Jeff Hornacek, and Shaquille O'Neal fouled out with 1:46 remaining in the fourth quarter. Bryant shot four air balls at the end of the game; the Jazz won 98–93 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 4–1. He first missed a game-winning two-point jump shot in the fourth quarter, and then misfired 3 three-point field goals in overtime, including two tying shots in the final minute.[62] O'Neal commented that \"[Bryant] was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that.\"[63]\n",
      "\n",
      "In Bryant's second season, he received more playing time and began to show more of his abilities as a talented young guard. As a result, Bryant's point averages more than doubled, from 7.6 to 15.4 points per game.[64] Bryant would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers \"played small\", which would feature Bryant playing small forward alongside the guards he would usually back up.[65] Bryant was the runner-up for the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year Award,[66] and through fan voting, he also became the youngest NBA All-Star starter in NBA history.[67] He was joined by teammates O'Neal, Van Exel, and Jones, making it the first time since 1983 that four players on the same team were selected to play in the same All-Star Game. Bryant's 15.4 points per game was the highest of any non-starter in the season.[68]\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1998–99 season marked Bryant's emergence as a premier guard in the league. With starting guards Van Exel and Jones traded, Bryant started every game for the lockout-shortened 50-game season. During the season, Bryant signed a six-year contract extension worth $70 million.[68] This kept him with the Lakers until the end of the 2003–04 season. Even at an early stage of his career, sportswriters were comparing his skills to those of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.[53][69][70] The playoff results, however, were no better, as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals.[71]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryant's fortunes would improve when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999.[72] After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances in the league's All-NBA,[73] All-Star, and All-Defensive teams.[74] The Lakers became championship contenders behind the center-guard combination of Bryant and O'Neal. Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view.[75]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryant was sidelined for six weeks prior to the start of the 1999–2000 season due to a hand injury that he had incurred during a preseason game against the Washington Wizards.[76] When Bryant was back and playing over 38 minutes a game, he had an increase in all statistical categories during the 1999–2000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of O'Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All-NBA Team Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player to receive defensive honors).[77] While playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some clutch performances including a 25-point, 11 rebound, 7 assist, 4 block game in game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.[78] He also threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the 2000 Finals, against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers' Jalen Rose's foot. Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally.[79][80] Bryant did not return to the game, and he also missed Game 3 due to the injury. In Game 4, Bryant scored 22 points in the second half and led the team to an OT victory as O'Neal fouled out of the game. Bryant scored the winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120–118.[81] With a 116–111 Game 6 victory, the Lakers won their first championship since 1988.[82]\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistically, the 2000–01 season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year, but he averaged six more points per game (28.5). It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O'Neal began to surface.[83] Once again, Bryant led the team in assists, with five per game. The Lakers, however, only won 56 games, an 11-game dropoff from the previous year. The Lakers would respond by going 15–1 in the playoffs. They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. In the semifinals round, the Lakers swept the Sacramento Kings. In Game 4 against the Kings, Bryant recorded 48 points, 16 rebounds and 3 assists in a 119–113 series-clinching win.[84] They swept the San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals to advance to the Finals, before losing their first game against the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime. They would go on to win the next four games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs, teammate O'Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league.[42] Bryant ended up making the All NBA Second team and All NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition, he was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the third year in a row (no game in 1999).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2001–02 season, Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. On January 14, 2002, Bryant recorded a then career-high 56 points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 120–81 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies.[85] He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Bryant also had a career-high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. He claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were \"going to cut your hearts out\".[86][87] While making the All-NBA Defensive team again, Bryant was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second in the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento Kings. Bryant was suspended one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers after the Lakers' March 1, 2002 victory over the Pacers.[88][89]\n",
      "\n",
      "The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the previous year. While the Lakers swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 4–1 in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Lakers did not have home-court advantage against the Sacramento Kings. The series would stretch to seven games, the first time this had happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the 2002 Finals, against the New Jersey Nets, Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the team's points.[90] At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships.[90] Bryant's play was notable and praised for his performance in the fourth quarter of games, specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs.[90][91] This cemented Bryant's reputation as a \"clutch player\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first game of the 2002–03 season, Bryant recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals in an 87–82 loss to the visiting Spurs.[92] On November 1, Bryant recorded a triple-double of 33 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists in a 108–93 win over the LA Clippers.[93] He also set an NBA record for three-pointers in a game on January 7, 2003, when he made 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics.[94] Bryant averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In addition, he averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career-highs to that point.[13] Bryant was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive first teams,[13] and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs.[95]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following season, the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All-Stars Karl Malone and Gary Payton to make another push at the NBA championship.[96] Bryant was arrested for sexual assault before the season began.[97] This caused Bryant to miss some games due to court appearances or attend court earlier in the day and travel to play games later on the same day.[98] In the final game of the regular season, the Lakers played the Portland Trail Blazers. Bryant made two buzzer-beaters to win the game and the Pacific Division title. At the end of the fourth quarter, Bryant made a three-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to send it into overtime.[99] The game eventually went to a second overtime, in which Bryant made another three-pointer as time expired to lift the Lakers past the Blazers, 105–104.[99]\n",
      "\n",
      "With a starting lineup of O'Neal, Malone, Payton, and Bryant, the Lakers were able to reach the NBA Finals.[100] However, they were upset in five games by the Detroit Pistons, who won their first championship since 1990.[101] In that series, Bryant averaged 22.6 points per game and 4.4 assists. He shot 35.1% from the field.[102] Jackson's contract as coach was not renewed, and Rudy Tomjanovich took over.[103] O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, and Brian Grant.[104] The following day, Bryant declined an offer to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers and re-signed with the Lakers, on a seven-year contract.[105]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003–04 season and has several criticisms of Bryant. In the book, Jackson called Bryant \"un-coachable\".[106] Midway through the season, Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion.[107] Without Tomjanovich, stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers' season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen.[108] Bryant was the league's second-leading scorer at 27.6 points per game, but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast, and the Lakers went 34–48 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade.[109] The year signified a drop in Bryant's overall status in the NBA, as he did not make the NBA All-Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All-NBA Third Team.[110] During the season, Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and Ray Allen.[111][112]\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2005–06 season marked a crossroads in Bryant's basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant, Jackson returned to coach the Lakers.[113] Bryant endorsed the move, and by all appearances, the two men worked together well the second time around, leading the Lakers back into the playoffs. Bryant's individual scoring accomplishments posted resulted in the finest statistical season of his career. On December 20, 2005, Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks. Entering the fourth quarter, Bryant outscored the entire Mavericks team 62–61, the only time a player has done this through three quarters since the introduction of the shot clock.[114] When the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16, 2006, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, signifying a change in the feud that had festered between them.[115][116] A month later, at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game, the two were seen laughing together.[117]\n",
      "\n",
      "On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points in a 122–104 victory against the Toronto Raptors.[118] In addition to breaking the previous franchise record of 71 set by Elgin Baylor, Bryant's 81-point game was the second-highest point total in NBA history, surpassed only by Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962.[119] Whereas Chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win, Bryant created his own shot—mostly from the outside—in a game which the Lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until the fourth quarter.[120][121] Chamberlain, playing in an era when the games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful,[121][122] accounted for 59 percent of his team's points in Philadelphia's 169–147 win, compared to Bryant scoring 66 percent of the Lakers' 122 points.[123][124] In that same month, Bryant also became the first player since 1964 to score 45 points or more in four consecutive games, joining Chamberlain and Baylor as the only players to do so.[125] For the month of January, Bryant averaged 43.4 points per game,[126] the eighth highest single month scoring average in NBA history and highest for any player other than Chamberlain.[127] By the end of the 2005–06 season, Bryant set Lakers single-season franchise records for most 40-point games (27) and most points scored (2,832).[128] He won the league's scoring title for the first time by averaging 35.4 points per game, becoming just the fifth player in league history to average at least 35 in a season.[b] Bryant finished in fourth place in the voting for the 2006 NBA Most Valuable Player Award but received 22 first place votes—second only to winner Steve Nash.[131]\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the season, it was reported that Bryant would change his jersey number from 8 to 24 at the start of the 2006–07 season. Bryant's first high school number was 24 before he switched to 33.[132][133] After the Lakers' season ended, Bryant said on TNT that he wanted 24 as a rookie, but it was unavailable, as was 33, retired with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bryant wore 143 at the Adidas ABCD camp and chose 8 by adding those numbers.[133] In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers played well enough to reach a 3–1 series lead over the Phoenix Suns, culminating with Bryant's overtime-forcing and game-winning shots in Game 4. They came within six seconds of eliminating the second-seeded Suns in Game 6, however, they lost that game 126–118 in overtime.[134] Despite Bryant's 27.9 points per game in the series, the Lakers broke down and ultimately fell to the Suns in seven games.[134] After scoring 50 points on 20 of 35 shooting in the Game 6 loss, Bryant was criticized for only taking three shots in the second half of the 121–90 Game 7 loss to Phoenix.[135][136]\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 2006–07 season, Bryant was selected to his ninth All-Star Game appearance, and on February 18, he logged 31 points, 6 assists, and 6 steals, earning his second career All-Star Game MVP trophy.[137] Over the course of the season, Bryant became involved in a number of on-court incidents. On January 28 while attempting to draw contact on a potential game-winning jump shot, he flailed his arm, striking San Antonio Spurs guard Manu Ginóbili in the face with his elbow.[138] Following a league review, Bryant was suspended for the subsequent game at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks. The basis given for the suspension was that Bryant had performed an \"unnatural motion\" in swinging his arm backward.[139] Later, on March 6, he seemed to repeat the motion, this time striking Minnesota Timberwolves guard Marko Jarić.[138] On March 7, the NBA handed Bryant his second one-game suspension.[140] In his first game back on March 9, he elbowed Kyle Korver in the face which was retroactively re-classified as a Type 1 flagrant foul.[138]\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 16, Bryant scored a season-high 65 points in a home game against the Portland Trail Blazers, which helped end the Lakers 7-game losing streak. This was the second-best scoring performance of his 11-year career.[141] The following game, Bryant recorded 50 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves,[142] after which he scored 60 points in a road win against the Memphis Grizzlies—becoming the second Laker to score three straight 50-plus point games, a feat not seen since Jordan last did it in 1987.[143] The only other Laker to do so was Baylor, who also scored 50+ in three consecutive contests in December 1962.[143] In the following day, in a game against the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, Bryant scored 50 points, making him the second player in NBA history to have four straight 50-point games behind Chamberlain, who achieved it twice with streaks of five and seven.[144] Bryant finished the year with a total of ten 50-plus point games, surpassed only by Chamberlain.[c] Bryant also won his second straight scoring title that season.[145] Throughout the 2006–07 season, his jersey became the top selling NBA jersey in the United States and China.[146] A number of journalists have attributed the improved sales to Bryant's new number, as well as his continuing All-Star performance on the court.[147][148] In the 2007 NBA playoffs, the Lakers were once again eliminated in the first round by the Phoenix Suns, 4–1.[149]\n",

      "On May 27, 2007, ESPN reported that Bryant stated that he wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority.[150] Bryant later confirmed his desire for West's return to the franchise but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that did not take place.[151] However, three days later, on Stephen A. Smith's radio program, Bryant expressed anger over a Lakers \"insider\" who claimed that Bryant was responsible for Shaquille O'Neal's departure from the team, and publicly stated, \"I want to be traded.\"[152] Three hours after making that statement, Bryant stated in another interview that after having a conversation with head coach Jackson, he had reconsidered his decision and backed off his trade request.[153] Bryant was later shown in an infamous amateur video saying that center Andrew Bynum should have been traded for All-Star Jason Kidd.[154][155]\n",

      "Despite an injury to his shooting hand's small finger, described as \"a complete tear of the radial collateral ligament, an avulsion fracture, and a volar plate injury at the MCP joint\" that occurred in a game on February 5, 2008, Bryant played all 82 games of the regular season instead of opting for surgery. Regarding his injury, he stated, \"I would prefer to delay any surgical procedure until after our Lakers season, and this summer's Olympic Games. But, this is an injury that myself [sic] and the Lakers' medical staff will just have to continue to monitor on a day-to-day basis.\"[159] In early September 2008, Bryant decided not to have surgery to repair the injury.[160]\n",

I'm very proud to represent this organization, to represent this city.\"[162] West, who was responsible for bringing Bryant to the Lakers, was on hand at the press conference to observe Bryant receive his MVP trophy from NBA commissioner David Stern. Stern stated, \"Kobe deserved it. He's had just another great season. Doesn't surprise me one bit.\"[163] In addition to winning his MVP award, Bryant was the only unanimous selection to the All-NBA team on May 8, 2008, for the third straight season and sixth time in his career.[164] He would then headline the NBA All-Defensive First Team with Kevin Garnett, receiving 52 points overall including 24 first-place nods, earning his eighth selection.[165]\n",

In Game 1, Bryant, who said he made himself a decoy through most of the game, scored 18 of his 32 points in the final eight minutes to keep Los Angeles safely ahead.[166] That made Denver the first 50-win team to be swept out of the first round of the playoffs since the Memphis Grizzlies fell in four games to the San Antonio Spurs in 2004.[167] In the first game of the next round, against the Jazz, Bryant scored 38 points as the Lakers beat the Jazz in Game 1.[168] The Lakers won the next game as well, but dropped Games 3 and 4, even with Bryant putting up 33.5 points per game.[169] The Lakers then won the next two games to win the semifinals.[169] This set up a Western Conference Finals berth against the San Antonio Spurs. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in five games, sending themselves to the NBA Finals, against the Boston Celtics. This marked the fifth time in Bryant's career, and the first time without O'Neal, that he made the NBA Finals.[170] The Lakers then lost to the Boston Celtics in six games.[171]\n",

      "In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers opened the campaign by winning their first seven games.[172] Bryant led the team to tie the franchise record for most wins to start the season going 17–2,[173] and by the middle of December they compiled a 21–3 record. He was selected to his 11th consecutive All-Star Game as a starter,[174] and was named the Western Conference Player of the Month for December and January in addition to being named Western Conference Player of the week three times.[175] In a game against the Knicks on February 2, 2009, Bryant scored 61 points, setting a record for the most points scored at Madison Square Garden.[176] During the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, Bryant tallied 27 points, 4 assists, 4 rebounds, and 4 steals was awarded All-Star Game co-MVP with former teammate O'Neal.[177] The Lakers finished the regular season with the best record in the west (65–17). Bryant was runner-up in the MVP voting behind LeBron James,[178] and was selected to the All-NBA First Team and All-Defensive First Team for the seventh time in his career.\n",

By finishing off the Denver Nuggets in the Conference Finals in six games, the Lakers earned their second straight trip to the NBA Finals. The Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in five games. Bryant was awarded his first NBA Finals MVP trophy upon winning his fourth championship,[179] achieving series averages of 32.4 points, 7.4 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks.[180] He became the first player since West in the 1969 NBA Finals to average at least 32.4 points and 7.4 assists for a finals series[181] and the first since Jordan to average 30 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists for a title-winning team in the finals.[182]\n",

      "On April 2, 2010, Bryant signed a three-year contract extension worth $87 million.[192] Bryant finished the regular season missing four of the final five games, due to injuries to his knee and finger. Bryant suffered multiple injuries throughout the season and as a result, missed nine games. The Lakers began the playoffs as the number one seed in the Western Conference against the Oklahoma City Thunder,[193] eventually defeating them in six games.[194] The Lakers swept the Utah Jazz in the second round[195] and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced the Phoenix Suns. In Game 2, Bryant finished the game with 13 assists, setting a new playoff career-high; it was the most assists by a Laker in the playoffs since Magic Johnson had 13 in 1996.[196] The Lakers went on to win the series in six games capturing the Western Conference Championship and advancing to the NBA Finals for a third straight season.[197] In a rematch against the 2008 Champion Boston Celtics, Bryant, despite shooting 6 for 24 from the field, led the Lakers back from a 13-point third-quarter deficit in Game 7 to win the championship; he scored 10 of his game-high 23 points in the fourth quarter and finished the game with 15 rebounds. Bryant won his fifth championship and earned his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP award.[198] This marked the first time the Lakers won a Game 7 against the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals.[199] Bryant said that this was the most satisfying of all of his five championships.[200]\n",

      "Bryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total.[201] The Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first eight games.[202] In his ninth game of the season, playing against the Denver Nuggets, Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 26,000 career points.[203] Bryant also recorded his first triple-double since January 21, 2009.[204] On January 30 against the Celtics, he became the youngest player to score 27,000 points.[205] On February 1, 2011, Bryant became one of seven players with at least 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists.[206] In Boston on February 10, Bryant scored 20 of his 23 points in the second half as the Lakers rallied from an early 15-point deficit for a 92–86 win over the Celtics.[207] It was the Lakers' first victory of the season against one of the league's top four teams, as they entered the game 0–5 in previous matchups and had been outscored by an average of 11 points.[208] Bryant, selected to his 13th straight All-Star game after becoming the leading vote-getter, had 37 points, 14 rebounds, and three steals in the 2011 All-Star Game and won his fourth All-Star MVP, tying Hall of Famer Bob Pettit for the most All-Star MVP awards.[209][210] During the season, Bryant moved from 12th to 6th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list, passing John Havlicek, Dominique Wilkins, Oscar Robertson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Elvin Hayes, and Moses Malone.[211] Bryant finished the season averaging less than 20 shots a game, his fewest since the 2003–04 season.[212]\n",

      "On April 13, 2011, the NBA fined Bryant $100,000 for directing a gay slur at referee Bennie Adams in frustration in the previous day's game.[213][214][215] The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation praised the NBA's decision to fine Bryant, and the Human Rights Campaign said that Bryant's language was a \"disgrace\" and \"distasteful\". Bryant stated that he was open to discussing the matter with gay rights groups and wanted to appeal his fine.[216][217][218] He later apologized for the use of the word.[219][220] Bryant and other Lakers appeared in a Lakers public service announcement denouncing his behavior.[221] The team's quest for another three-peat was ended when they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round of the playoffs.[222]\n",

      "Bryant received experimental platelet-rich plasma therapy called Orthokine in Germany to treat the pain on his left knee and ankle,[223][224] and Mike Brown replaced the retired Jackson as coach of the Lakers in the off-season. Bryant began the season playing with an injured wrist.[225] On January 10, 2012, Bryant scored 48 points against the Suns. \"Not bad for the seventh-best player in the league\", said Bryant, referring to a preseason ESPN ranking of the NBA's top players.[226] He went on to score 40, 42, and 42 in his next three games.[227] It was the sixth time in his career he scored 40 or more points in four straight games, a feat exceeded only by Chamberlain (19 times).[228] At the 2012 NBA All-Star Game, Bryant scored 27 points to pass Jordan as the career scoring leader in the All-Star Game.[229] He also suffered a broken nose and a concussion in the third quarter of the All-Star Game after a hard foul from Dwyane Wade.[230] In April, Bryant missed seven games with a bruised left shin.[231] He returned three games before the end of the regular season. In the last game of the regular season, against Sacramento, he chose not to go for a possible third NBA scoring title, having needed 38 points to surpass Kevin Durant.[232] The Lakers were knocked out of the playoffs by Durant's Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the playoffs, losing in five games.[233]\n",

      "The Lakers in 2012–13 acquired center Dwight Howard and point guard Steve Nash. On November 2, 2012, Bryant scored 40 points with two steals, and he passed Magic Johnson (1,724) as the Lakers career leader in steals. However, the Lakers lost the game to the Clippers and started the season 0–3 for the first time in 34 years and just the fourth time in franchise history.[234] After starting the season 1–4, coach Brown was fired.[235] He was replaced by Mike D'Antoni, who Bryant knew as a child when Bryant's father was playing in Italy and D'Antoni was also a star player there. Bryant had grown close with D'Antoni during their time with Team USA.[236][237] On December 5 against New Orleans, Bryant became the youngest player (34 years and 104 days) in league history to score 30,000 points, joining Hall of Famers Chamberlain, Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Karl Malone as one of five players to reach that milestone.[238] On December 18, in a 101–100 win over the Charlotte Bobcats, Bryant scored 30+ points in his seventh consecutive game, the longest streak by an NBA player after turning 34 years old; it was the fourth-longest such streak in his career.[239] His streak would be snapped at 10 on December 28 in a 104–87 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, when he scored 27 points, sitting out the whole fourth quarter.[240] In a move to improve the team's defense, D'Antoni began having Bryant guard the opponent's best perimeter player; Bryant was the primary defender on the Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving, who was held to 15 points.[241][242] Bryant acknowledged he was a more focused defender when he had a challenging defensive assignment as opposed to when he played off the ball against weaker players.[242][243] His defense disrupted opponents and freed Nash from unfavorable matchups.[244]\n",

      "Bryant was leading the league in scoring through much of the first 42 games.[245] With a disappointing 17–25 start to the season,[246] D'Antoni had Bryant became the primary facilitator on offense and Nash was moved off the ball and became more of a spot-up shooter.[247][248][249] In the next three games, Bryant had at least 10 assists in three wins with a three-game total of 39 assists, the most in his career. He missed a triple-double in each game with nine rebounds twice and eight in the other.[250][251] In two crucial wins in March, he scored at least 40 points and had at least 10 assists in back-to-back games, becoming the first Laker to accomplish the feat since West in 1970.[252][253]\n",

      "With the Lakers fighting to secure the eighth and final playoff berth in the Western Conference, coupled with injuries on the team, Bryant began playing almost all 48 minutes each game.[254] On April 10, 2013, Bryant became the first player in NBA history to get 47 points, eight rebounds, five assists, four blocks, and three steals in an NBA game. On April 12, Bryant suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors, ending his season. His injury came while he was playing seven consecutive quarters and at least 40 minutes for seven consecutive games. The 34-year-old Bryant was averaging his most minutes (38.6) in six years, and only Portland rookie Damian Lillard was averaging more minutes. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak had spoken to Bryant about his extensive playing time 10 days earlier, but Bryant insisted the minutes needed to continue given the Lakers' playoff push.[255] Bryant had surgery on April 13 to repair the tear, and it was estimated he would miss six to nine months.[256] He ended the season with his customary numbers scoring an average of 27.3 points, 46.3 percent shooting, 5.6 rebounds, and 6 assists. However, The New York Times called his leading of the Lakers back into playoff contention \"perhaps some of the finest work of his career.\"[257] Eight times he reached 40 points during the season, and eleven times he had 10 or more assists in his role as distributor, dubbed \"Magic Mamba\" after the passing skills of Magic Johnson. Bryant's assists were the second-highest of his career and his field goal percentage was its highest since 2008–09.[253] The Lakers finished the season at 45–37, good for seventh in the West. Playing without Bryant, the Lakers were swept in four games by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs.[258]\n",

      "Bryant resumed practicing in November 2013, after the 2013–2014 season had already begun. On November 25, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million.[259] He remained the league's highest-paid player, although he accepted a discounted deal; he had been eligible to receive an extension starting at $32 million per year.[260] Bryant's contract became a polarizing topic, with detractors arguing that stars should take less money to allow their team more financial freedom, while supporters countered that the NBA's biggest stars were being paid less than their true value.[261][262][263] Bryant resumed playing on December 8 after missing the season's first 19 games. On December 17, Bryant matched his season high of 21 points in a 96–92 win over Memphis, but he suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee that was expected to sideline him for six weeks.[264] He had played six games since returning from his Achilles injury, which included time at point guard after injuries to Nash, Steve Blake, and Jordan Farmar.[265] Bryant was averaging 13.8 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds.[266] Despite being sidelined, he was voted by fans to start in his 16th All-Star game. Bryant did not feel he was deserving of the selection, and some likened it to a career achievement award for his past performance.[267] However, he missed playing in the game, still hampered by his knee.[268] On March 12, 2014, the Lakers ruled Bryant out for the remainder of the season, citing his need for more rehab and the limited time remaining in the season. At the time, the team was 22–42 and tied for the worst record in the Western Conference. The Lakers finished 27–55 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005.[266]\n",

      "After recovering to play in the 2015–16 preseason,[289] Bryant suffered a calf injury and missed the final two weeks of exhibition games.[290] However, he played in the season opener to begin his 20th season with the Lakers, surpassing John Stockton's league record of 19 for the most seasons with the same team.[291] On November 24, 2015, the Lakers fell to 2–12 after losing 111–77 to the Warriors. Bryant scored just four points in 25 minutes on 1-for-14 shooting, matching the worst-shooting game of his career in which he attempted at least five shots.[292][293] On December 1, 2015, Bryant played his last game against his hometown team, the Philadelphia 76ers, where the Lakers lost 103–91.[294]\n",

My love for this city, this team and for each of you will never fade. Thank you for this incredible journey.\"[295]\n",

      "At the time of his announcement, he was second on the team in minutes (30.8) behind Jordan Clarkson and leading the team with 16.7 field goal attempts per game, while averaging just 15.7 points and shooting a career-low 31.5 percent.[293][296] His free throw attempts had dropped from his career average, and his game had become over-reliant on pump fakes and long-range shots, making a league-worst 19.5 percent from three-point range while attempting seven a game, almost double his career average.[296][297] In his press conference after the announcement, he acknowledged his declining skills. \"Even though I play like shit, I've worked really, really hard not to play like crap and I do everything I possibly can. And I feel good about that\", he said.[298][299]\n",

      "Bryant requested that opposing teams on the road not hold any on-court ceremonies in his honor or present him any gifts in public.[300] Prior to announcing his retirement, he had been steadfast about not wanting the fuss of a staged farewell tour, preferring to hear boos instead of cheers.[301][302] Still, he was honored around the league with video tributes and fan ovations,[300] including arenas that historically jeered him such as TD Garden in Boston, Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento, and Vivint Smart Home Arena in Salt Lake City.[303][304][305] Previously, Bryant was respected but not beloved,[306][307] and he was astonished at the cheers he was now receiving.[307]\n",

The win ended a 10-game losing streak, and the Lakers averted establishing the longest losing streak in franchise history.[308] He became just the fourth NBA player over 37 years old to log at least 35 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a game.[f] Bryant was the leading overall vote-getter for the 2016 All-Star Game with 1.9 million votes, ahead of Stephen Curry's 1.6 million. Having moved to small forward that season, Bryant was selected as a frontcourt starter for the first time.[309] Playing in his first All-Star game since 2013, Bryant had 10 points, six rebounds, and seven assists.[310] West teammates offered to feed him the ball in an attempt to get him another All-Star MVP, but he declined.[310][311]\n",

      "Bryant primarily played as a shooting guard. He was listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and 212 pounds (96 kg),[328] He was often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA.[329][330] Bryant has drawn frequent comparisons to Jordan, after whom he modeled his playing style.[331][332][333] Like Jordan, he became most known for shooting a fall-away jump shot.[334] Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated described another of Bryant's most famous moves as the \"jab step-and-pause\": Bryant jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax, but instead of bringing the jab foot back, he pushed off of it and drove around his opponent to get to the basket.[335]\n",

      "Bryant established a reputation for taking shots in the closing moments of tight games,[336][337][338] even when he was double or triple-teamed,[339] and was noted as one of the premier closers in the NBA.[339][340] In a 2012 annual survey of NBA general managers, Bryant was selected for the 10th consecutive season as the player general managers would want to take a clutch shot with a game on the line.[341][342]Bryant enjoyed being the villain, and reveled in being booed and then silencing the crowd with his play.[87][307][343] His ability to make difficult shots has also drawn criticism of his shot selection.[333][344] Throughout his career, Bryant was disparaged for being a selfish, high-volume shooter;[342][345][346] he missed more field goal attempts in his career than any other player in NBA history.[g] Phil Jackson, who coached Bryant for many years, stated that Bryant \"tends to force the action, especially when the game isn't going his way. When his shot is off, Kobe will pound away relentlessly until his luck turns.\"[348] According to Bryant, \"I would go 0 for 30 before I would go 0 for 9; 0 for 9 means you beat yourself, you psyched yourself out of the game.\"[120]\n",

      "Bryant was also lauded for his work ethic.[354] Throughout his first 16 seasons, his body was resilient,[286] and he exhibited a high pain threshold while often playing through injuries.[355][356] A fierce competitor, Bryant made opponents and teammates alike the objects of his scorn.[357][358] Many players have considered him difficult to play with because of his high level of commitment and performance.[359][360][361] According to sportswriter Mark Heisler of Forbes, \"circa 2004–2007, Kobe was the most alienated superstar the NBA had ever seen.\"[362] He did, however, lead the Lakers to two championships after the departure of Shaquille O'Neal; during this period, he became more of a mentor to his teammates than he had been earlier in his career.[359][362] Bryant's longtime head coach Phil Jackson noted that the biggest difference between his first and second stints in coaching the Lakers was if Bryant talked to teammates in his earlier years with the Lakers, it was usually, \"Give me the damn ball.\" During the latter period, \"[Bryant] embraced the team and his teammates, calling them up when we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner.

      "With career averages of 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game,[328] he was considered one of the most complete players in NBA history.[376] He was the first player in NBA history to have at least 30,000 career points and 6,000 career assists,[364] and was one of only four players with 25,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 6,000 assists.[377] Bryant led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons.[13] His 81-point performance against Toronto in 2006 was the second-highest in NBA history,[378] behind only Chamberlain's 100. He scored at least 50 points 24 times in his career, which is third in league history behind Jordan (31) and Chamberlain (118);[296] six times Bryant scored at least 60.[379] He was just the third player in NBA history to average 40 points in a calendar month, which he accomplished four times.[h] Bryant was voted the league MVP in 2008 and led his team to the 2008 NBA Finals as the first seed in the Western Conference.[380] In the 2008 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. men's basketball team, occasionally referred to as \"The Redeem Team\".[381] He won another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The two began dating and became engaged six months later in May 2000,[389] while Laine was still a senior at Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California. To avoid media scrutiny, she finished high school through independent study.[389] According to Vanessa's cousin Laila Laine, there was no prenuptial agreement.

Bryant's parents were opposed to the marriage for a number of reasons. Reportedly Bryant's parents had problems with him marrying so young, especially to a woman who was not African-American.[i][389] This disagreement resulted in an estrangement period of over two years, which ended when the couple's first daughter was born.[394]\n",

Their second daughter, Gianna Maria-Onore (also referred to as \"Gigi\"), was born in May 2006.[396] On December 16, 2011, Vanessa Bryant filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, and the couple requested joint custody of their daughters.[397][398] On January 11, 2013, Bryant and his wife both announced via social media that they had called off their divorce.[399] In early December 2016, Vanessa gave birth to their third daughter,[400][401][402] and in January 2019 the Bryants announced they were expecting a fourth daughter.[403] Their daughter was born in June 2019.[404][405]\n",

Bryant's mother received $450,000 from the auction house for the items, and contended Bryant had given her the rights to the items he had remaining in her home. However, Bryant's lawyers asked the auction house to return the items.[418] Before the scheduled trial, a settlement was reached allowing the auction house the sale of less than 10% of the items.

      "In the summer of 2003, the sheriff's office of Eagle, Colorado, arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Eagle County in advance of undergoing knee surgery nearby. The accuser stated that Bryant raped her in his hotel room the night before Bryant was to have the procedure. Bryant admitted to an adulterous sexual encounter with his accuser but denied her sexual assault allegation.[425][426]\n",

      "The accusation tarnished Bryant's reputation, and the public's perception of him plummeted; his endorsement contracts with McDonald's and Nutella were terminated. Sales for Bryant's replica jersey fell significantly.[427] However, in September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser decided not to testify at the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public mea culpa:[428][429]\n",

Many companies like McDonald's and Ferrero SpA terminated his contracts when rape allegations against him became public.[435] A notable exception was Nike, Inc., who had signed him to a five-year, $40–45 million contract just before the incident.[436][437] However, they refused to use his image or market a new shoe of his for the year but eventually did start promoting Bryant once his image recovered two years later.[437] He has since resumed endorsement deals with The Coca-Cola Company, through their subsidiary Energy Brands, to promote their Vitamin Water brand of drinks.[438] Bryant was also the cover athlete for NBA '07: Featuring the Life Vol. 2 and appeared in commercials for the video games Guitar Hero World Tour (with Tony Hawk, Michael Phelps, and Alex Rodriguez) in 2008 and Call of Duty: Black Ops (alongside Jimmy Kimmel) in 2010.[439]\n",

The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant's youth and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by Sway & King Tech and recorded a verse for a remix of Brian McKnight's \"Hold Me\".

The single debuted in January 2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month; the song was not well received.

So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time.\"[10] He overcame his awkwardness to become a standout for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities, despite his having picked up the game only in ninth grade.[11] Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom, in particular, grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game.[7] Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket.[7] Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation.[12] However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention and discovered that he was not only a talented athlete but also a quick learner.[12] Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware, and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the year before Duncan's arrival at Wake Forest University, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, but then lost leading scorer Rodney Rogers, who entered the 1993 NBA draft.[7] In the 1993–94 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was considering redshirting Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man Makhtar N'Diaye violated NCAA rules and eventually transferred to Michigan.[13] Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate Randolph Childress led the Deacons to a 20–11 win–loss record.[7] Duncan's style of play was simple yet effective, combining an array of low-post moves, mid-range bank shots, and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 Goodwill Games.[7] Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature.[12] Despite his heavy focus on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best said, \"Tim [...] was one of my more intellectual students. [...] Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest.\"[12] Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as \"Mr. Spock\", the prototypical logical, detached character from Star Trek.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1994–95 NCAA season, the sophomore was soon called one of the best prospects among the eligible for the NBA, along with peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace, and Jerry Stackhouse.[7] Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early; however, Duncan said that he had no intention of going pro before graduation, despite the NBA's plan to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. Though it meant passing up a large amount of money, Duncan was loath to deviate from his determination to stay in school.[7] In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against the Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime.[7] In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16. Playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but Wake Forest still lost, 71–66. Duncan ended the season averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year, and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game.[7] He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 1995–96 NCAA season, the Wake Forest team lost Childress, who had graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. In Childress's absence, Duncan led the team to a 12–4 record for their ACC season, and a 26–6 record overall.[7] The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the Final Four. His season averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game led to another ACC Defensive Player of the Year award and his first ACC Player of the Year award.[14] Although the Wake Forest star was now rumored to be entering the 1996 NBA draft, he stayed in college.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1996–97 NCAA season, new 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) Demon Deacon and future NBA player Loren Woods eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The 1996-97 team won their first 13 games, but then came a slump, and they failed to win a third ACC title.[7] Later, during the NCAA tournament, Stanford University, led by future NBA point guard Brevin Knight, eliminated Wake Forest with a 72–66 win. Duncan finished his senior season with career high averages of 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game while shooting .606 from the field and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for a third straight season. He earned first-team All-American honors for the second time and was a unanimous pick for both the Oscar Robertson Trophy and Naismith College Player of the Year.[7] Duncan was first in the 1996–97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, tenth in blocked shots (3.3 bpg), and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg).[14] He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and, based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters, won the 1997 John Wooden Award as the NCAA's best overall male player.[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, or Kobe Bryant, Duncan stayed in college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year and a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997 and the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997. In 1996, he led the ACC in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage, and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories.[14] That same year, he was also named Most Valuable Player of the ACC Tournament. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and finished his college career as the all-time leading rebounder in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (a mark later surpassed by Kenneth Faried). Duncan left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks—at the time second in NCAA annals behind Colgate's Adonal Foyle—and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "In college, Duncan co-authored a chapter in the social psychology book Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors.[16][17] After earning his college degree,[18] Duncan became eligible for the 1997 NBA draft.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1997 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs drafted Duncan with the first draft pick.[3] The Spurs were coming off an injury-riddled 1996–97 season; their best player, David Robinson—himself a number one draft pick in 1987—was sidelined for most of the year, and they had finished with a 20–62 win–loss record.[20] In the 1997–98 season, Duncan and Robinson became known as the \"Twin Towers\". The duo earned a reputation for their exceptional defense close to the basket.[7] From the beginning, Duncan established himself as a quality player: In his second road game, he grabbed 22 rebounds against opposing Chicago Bulls Hall of Fame power forward Dennis Rodman, a multiple rebounding champion and NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[21] Duncan was voted to the 1998 NBA All-Star Game by coaches. Later, when Duncan played against opposing Houston Rockets Hall of Fame power forward Charles Barkley, Barkley was so impressed he said: \"I have seen the future and he wears number 21.\"[22] In his rookie season, Duncan lived up to expectations of being the number one draft pick, starting in all 82 regular-season games, averaging 21.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, and earning All-NBA First Team honors.[3] His defensive contributions ensured that he was elected to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team and was also named NBA Rookie of the Year, having won the NBA Rookie of the Month award every single month that season.[11][23] Spurs coach Gregg Popovich lauded Duncan's mental toughness, stating his rookie's \"demeanor was singularly remarkable\", Duncan always \"put things into perspective\" and never got \"too upbeat or too depressed.\"[24] Center Robinson was equally impressed with Duncan: \"He's the real thing. I'm proud of his attitude and effort. He gives all the extra effort and work and wants to become a better player.\"[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spurs qualified for the 1998 NBA Playoffs as the fifth seed, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns coach Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds[26] and replicating the performance in Game 2,[27] contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns.[7] However, the Spurs lost in the second round to the eventual Western Conference Champions Utah Jazz.[28]\n",
      "\n",
      "During the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Spurs started with a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach and finished the season with a 31–5 run.[29] The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams.[3] In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3–1, swept the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, and defeated the Cinderella story New York Knicks 4–1 in the Finals.[30] In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero,[31] and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the \"Twin Towers\" outscored their Knicks counterparts Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks.[31] After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win,[31] and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. Double teamed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second desperation shot,[31] and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point and 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship.[32] Sports Illustrated journalist and retired NBA player Alex English added: \"Duncan came up big each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [in Game 5].\" And Popovich later said to losing coach Jeff Van Gundy: \"I've got Tim [Duncan] and you don't. That's the difference.\"[32]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1999–2000 season, Duncan further cemented his reputation. He averaged 23.2 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.2 blocks per game, earning another pair of All-NBA and All-Defense First Team nods.[3] However, the Spurs had a disappointing post-season. Duncan injured his meniscus shortly before the end of the regular season and was unable to play in even one postseason game.[11] Consequently, the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the 2000 NBA Playoffs, losing 3–1 to the Phoenix Suns.[33]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next season, Duncan averaged 22.2 points, 12.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.3 blocks per game. He was again named to the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams.[3] In the 2001 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs eliminated the Timberwolves 3–1, defeated the Dallas Mavericks 4–1, but then bowed out against the Lakers (led by superstars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant) in four straight games.[34] Sports Illustrated described the series as a \"[m]erciless mismatch\", and Duncan was criticized as \"silent when the Spurs need him most\".[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "On the back of two consecutive playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs.[3] Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team nods, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as one of only two Spurs players in history to have earned the honor.[36] On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled with the fact that the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often.[7] In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions.[37] Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: \"I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes.\"[38] Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as \"phenomenal\" and criticized his supporting cast.[38]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2002–03 season, the Spurs began play at the SBC Center on November 1 by defeating the Toronto Raptors 91–72. In that game, Duncan recorded 22 points, 15 rebounds and 3 blocks for the Spurs.[39] He averaged 23.3 points, a career-high 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game, and earned All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team recognition, resulting in his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[3][7] At age 37, Robinson had announced that the season would be his last; his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs.[7] The Spurs qualified easily for the playoffs, concluding the regular season as the Western Conference's number one seed with a 60–22 record.[40] In the Western Conference Semifinals against the Lakers, Duncan dominated forward Robert Horry[41] and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds.[41] The Spurs made it to the finals, and defeated the New Jersey Nets 88–77 in Game 6 to win another NBA championship.[42] Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a quadruple double in the final game,[43] and was named the NBA Finals MVP.[11] Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named Sports Illustrated's 2003 \"Sportsmen of the Year\".[44]\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs lost their perennial captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming off the bench were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis.[45] In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant to step into the void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills.[46] Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks,[3] he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater, giving his team the win.[47][48] In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as one of the reasons for the loss.[49]\n",
      "\n",
      "Duncan and his Spurs looked to re-assert themselves in the next 2004–05 season. Despite their new captain's slight statistical slump (20.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.6 blocks per game),[3] the Spurs won the second seed for the 2005 NBA Playoffs by winning 59 games.[50] In the first round, the Spurs eliminated the Denver Nuggets four games to one, and met the Seattle SuperSonics in the semi-finals. After splitting the first four games, Duncan led his team to two decisive victories,[7] setting up a meeting with the Phoenix Suns, known for their up-tempo basketball. The Spurs managed to beat the Suns at their own game, defeating them 4–1[7] and earning a spot in the 2005 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons. In the Finals, Duncan was pitted against Detroit's defensively strong frontcourt anchored by multiple NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace. After two convincing Game 1 and 2 wins for the Spurs, the Pistons double teamed Duncan and forced him to play further from the basket.[7] Detroit won the next two games and the series was eventually tied at 3–3, but Duncan was instrumental in Game 7, recording 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Spurs defeated the Pistons.[51] NBA.com reported that \"with his unique multidimensional talent, Duncan depleted and dissected the Pistons... He was the fulcrum of virtually every key play down the stretch\", and coach Popovich added: \"[Duncan's] complete game is so sound, so fundamental, so unnoticed at times, because if he didn't score, people think, 'Well, he didn't do anything'. But he was incredible and he was the force that got it done for us.\"[51] Pistons center Ben Wallace remarked: \"He put his team on his shoulders and carried them to a championship [...t]hat's what the great players do.\"[51] Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award, joining Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to win it three times.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 2005–06 season, Duncan suffered from plantar fasciitis for most of the season,[52] which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances.[3] The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense.[53] But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.[53]\n",
      "\n",
      "The following season, however, was another championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per game in the regular season,[3] and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth appearance in the event. In the playoffs, he led the Spurs to a 4–1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4–2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4–1 win against the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals, setting up a meeting with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals.[54] There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4–0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth ever championship.[55] Duncan proclaimed that that championship was \"the best\" of his four championships; however, he also acknowledged he played \"sub-par\" and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten.[46] His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the \"Tim Duncan era\", and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: \"Tim is the common denominator. He's [had] a different cast around him [in] '99, '03 and '05. He's welcomed them all. [...] But he is that easy to play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that other people can fit in.\"[46] Then-NBA commissioner David Stern added: \"[Duncan] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and Pete Sampras is one of the greats. OK, he wasn't Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. He just happens to be one of the greatest players of all time. You take great players as you find them.\"[46]\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend, Duncan was a member of the San Antonio team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.[56] For the season, he played 78 games and posted his typical 20/10 numbers,[57] San Antonio concluded the 2007–08 regular season with a 56–26 record, finishing behind the Lakers and New Orleans Hornets in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Suns. The Suns—defeated by the Spurs in three of the past four seasons of playoffs—were out for revenge and featured a new player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point game and a rare three-pointer that sent the game into double overtime.[58] The trio of Duncan, Ginóbili and Parker continued playing to form for the remainder of the series, and the Spurs eliminated the Suns in five games.[59] In the first game of the next round against the Chris Paul-led Hornets, San Antonio was badly defeated 101–82 as Duncan played one of the worst playoff games in his career, recording only 5 points and 3 rebounds.[60] The Spurs dropped the next game as well, but recovered in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan putting up a team-high 22 point/15 rebound/4 block performance in the game that tied the series.[61] Duncan then recorded 20 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6,[62] and the Spurs relied on their experience to seal the series in Game 7.[63] However, arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers defeated San Antonio in five games in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.[64]\n",
      "\n",
      "Duncan started the 2008–09 season with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his performance declined and he was subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee tendinosis.[65] Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili for most of the season, San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record.[66][67] Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship.[67] As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000.[68]\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Spurs looking to provide a more solid supporting cast in the 2009–10 season, they acquired Richard Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Antonio McDyess, DeJuan Blair, and Keith Bogans.[69] The team got off to a 5–6 start, but a series of double double performances by Duncan gave them a 9–6 record by the end of November. Duncan was subsequently named the Western Conference Player of the Week for the last week of November.[70] Even at 34 years of age, he remained a constant 20–10 threat, being only one of three players in the league at the mid-season to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game. On January 21, 2010, Duncan was named as the starting forward for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.[71] After securing yet another 50-win season,[72] the Spurs qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, and defeated Dallas 4–2 in the first round, only to lose 4–0 to Phoenix in the next round.[73]\n",
      "\n",
      "Eleven games into the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played.[74] Along the way, the Spurs compiled a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors.[75] 12 days later, in a game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games.[76] The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history[77]–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season.[78] Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spurs again finished the 2011–12 season as the number one seed in the West—it was a lockout-shortened 66-game season—tying with the Chicago Bulls for a league-best 50–16 record. Prior to a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on March 24, 2012, head coach Gregg Popovich decided to give Duncan a night off by listing him on the official scorecard as \"DNP-OLD\", poking fun at his 36-year-old body.[79] Overall, Duncan's numbers remained at par with the previous season. The triumvirate of Duncan-Parker-Ginóbili entered the 2012 NBA Playoffs well-rested and healthy, and the Spurs swept the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers 4–0 in the first two rounds. On May 31, 2012, in the third game of the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Duncan set the record for most career blocks in playoffs history, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Spurs' playoff run came to an end when the Thunder defeated them 4–2.\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 11, 2012, Duncan agreed to re-sign with the Spurs. Helped by a supporting cast comprising Danny Green, Tiago Splitter, Gary Neal and Kawhi Leonard that had been maturing steadily over the last two seasons, Duncan and the Spurs would again make the playoffs with a 58–24 regular season record. Duncan also returned to the All-Star line-up and was named to the All-NBA First Team. He finished the regular season with 23,785 career points, which broke George Gervin's record for most points in a Spurs uniform (23,602). In the playoffs, the Spurs swept the Los Angeles Lakers, beat Golden State in six games and defeated the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals in a 4–0 sweep to reach the NBA Finals. In game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, Duncan recorded his 500th playoff block, becoming the first player in NBA history to reach that milestone, although the NBA did not track blocks prior to the 1973–74 season.[80][81] The Spurs met defending NBA champions Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in a tightly contested series. Miami had home court advantage, but San Antonio took the first game and headed into game 6 with a 3–2 lead. In that game, Duncan scored 25 points in the first half, his biggest haul in a half of an NBA Finals game. However, the Spurs lost the game in overtime, and then lost the deciding seventh game.\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 2, 2013, Duncan became the oldest player to record a 20–20 game in NBA history, finishing with 23 points, 21 rebounds and the game-winning jump shot against the Atlanta Hawks. The Spurs went on to conclude the 2013–14 regular season with a league-best 62 wins. The Spurs defeated Dallas in seven games in the first round of the playoffs, Portland in five games in the conference semifinals, and Oklahoma City in six games, where game 6 went into overtime, as the Spurs won, 112–107. They set up a Finals rematch against the Miami Heat, which they won, 4–1, setting a record margin for a win in the NBA Finals, for games 3 and 4. Along the way, the Duncan-Ginóbili-Parker trio broke the record for most wins in NBA Playoffs history. After winning the Finals in five games, Duncan joined John Salley as the only players to win a championship in three different decades.[82]\n",

      "On June 23, 2014, Duncan exercised his $10.3 million player option for the 2014–15 season.[83][84] On November 14, 2014, Duncan scored his 25,000th point in the first half of the Spurs' 93–80 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, becoming the 19th player in NBA history to reach the milestone.[85] On February 19, 2015, he passed Alex English to move into 16th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 30 points against the Los Angeles Clippers.[86] On March 4, he recorded six rebounds against the Sacramento Kings, breaking his tie with Nate Thurmond for ninth in career rebounding.[87] Two days later, he recorded three blocks against the Denver Nuggets to surpass Patrick Ewing for sixth overall in career blocks.[88] On April 12, he played his 1,330th career game against the Phoenix Suns, which passed Moses Malone for 11th all-time. He also scored 22 points and passed Kevin Garnett to move into 14th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list.[89] The Spurs finished sixth in the Western Conference after 82 games and faced the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. Their quest for back-to-back championships was ended May 2 as they lost to the Clippers in seven games.[90] Duncan was later named to the All-Defensive second team on May 20 for the seventh time in his career.[91]\n",

      "On July 9, 2015, Duncan re-signed with the Spurs to a two-year deal.[92] On November 2, 2015, in a win over the New York Knicks, Duncan recorded 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in his NBA-record 954th victory with one team, surpassing John Stockton's 953 wins with the Utah Jazz.[93] On November 11, he pulled down rebound number 14,716 for his career against the Portland Trail Blazers to pass Robert Parish for seventh place on the NBA's all-time rebounding list.[94] On November 14, in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers, Duncan had five blocked shots to become the Spurs' franchise leader with 2,955 blocks, surpassing former teammate David Robinson's career total of 2,954. Duncan also moved into fifth all-time on the NBA's blocks list.[95] After missing the Spurs' last three games of December due to rest and right knee soreness, Duncan returned to action on January 2, 2016, against the Houston Rockets. In his return game, Duncan was held scoreless for the first time in his 19-year career;[96] giving him the most consecutive games with at least one point, at 1,359.[97] Four days later, Duncan scored a then season-high 18 points in a 123–98 win over the Utah Jazz, helping the Spurs extend its franchise-record home winning streak to 30 straight regular-season games dating to 2014–15.[98] On February 10, he returned to the starting lineup after missing eight games with a sore knee.[99] On February 27, in a win over the Houston Rockets, he became the fifth player in NBA history to reach 3,000 blocks. In addition, with six rebounds in the game, Duncan reached 14,971 for his career, passing Karl Malone (14,968) for sixth place in league history.[100] On March 10, Duncan became the sixth player in league history with 15,000 rebounds, completing the feat midway through the first quarter of the Spurs' 109–101 win over the Chicago Bulls.[101] On March 19, he came off the bench for only the third time in his career to counter the smaller lineup of the Golden State Warriors. With a win over the Warriors, the Spurs recorded their 35th straight home win of the season and their 44th straight at home dating to 2014–15, tied for the second-longest streak in NBA history with the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls.[102] On April 5, in a win over the Utah Jazz, he became the third player with 1,000 victories in the regular season, following Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish. Duncan extended his mark as the NBA's career leader in victories with one team.[103] On April 8, he scored a season-high 21 points in a losing effort to the Denver Nuggets. Having already locked up second seed in the West with a franchise best record (65–13 prior to Nuggets game), all four of Duncan's starting teammates were rested.[104] The Spurs went on to lose to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the playoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 28, 2016, Duncan opted into his $5.6 million contract for the 2016–17 season.[105] However, on July 11, 2016, he announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons with San Antonio.[106] In September 2016, coach Gregg Popovich indicated that Duncan would have a coaching role with the team in the 2016–17 season.[107]\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 18, 2016, the Spurs retired Duncan's No. 21 jersey in a postgame ceremony, making him the eighth Spur in franchise history to have his jersey retired.[108]\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 22, 2019, the San Antonio Spurs announced that Duncan had been named an assistant coach.[109][110][111] He made his debut as an acting head coach on March 3, 2020, leading the Spurs to a 104–103 comeback win over the Charlotte Hornets, which Popovich missed due to personal reasons.[112]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1998, Duncan was selected as one of the last two players for the United States national team for the World Basketball Championship. However, this team was later replaced with CBA and college players because of the NBA lockout.[114] Duncan's first chance at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10–0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but a knee injury forced him to stay out of the Olympic Games themselves.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2003, Duncan was also a member of the USA team that recorded ten wins and qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics.[14] He started all the games he played in and averaged team bests of 15.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.56 bpg, while shooting 60.7 percent from the field.[14] At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal.[115] The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA players became eligible that the U.S. men's basketball team returned home without gold medals at the Olympics.[115] After the tournament, Duncan commented, \"I am about 95 percent sure my FIBA career is over. I'll try not to share my experiences with anyone.\"[116] In total, Duncan was a member of five USA Basketball teams and played in 40 games.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing at 6 feet 11 inches tall (2.11 m) and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), Duncan was a power forward who could also play center. With a double-double career average in points and rebounds, he was considered one of the most consistent players in the NBA throughout his career.[51] Regarded as one of the league's best interior defenders, Duncan also ranked consistently as one of the top scorers, rebounders and shot-blockers in the league.[3] At the end of his final season in 2015–16, he was ranked first in regular season point-rebound double-doubles among active players,[117] while he led the charts in post-season point-rebound double-doubles (158 as of 2013–14). His main weakness for much of his career was his free throw shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from his impressive statistics, Duncan has gained a reputation as a good clutch player, as evidenced by his three NBA Finals MVP awards and his playoff career averages being higher than his regular season statistics.[3] Eleven-time NBA champion Bill Russell further compliments Duncan on his passing ability, and rates him as one of the most efficient players of his generation,[118] a view shared by 19-time NBA All-Star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.[119] Because of his versatility and success, basketball experts widely consider Duncan to be the greatest power forward in NBA history,[2][120] while coach Popovich and teammates Parker and Ginóbili have also credited much of San Antonio's success to him.[121][122] Duncan's detractors, however, label him as \"boring\" because of his simple but effective style of play (thus earning him the nickname \"The Big Fundamental\"). Following his first championship ring in 1999, Sports Illustrated described him as a \"quiet, boring MVP\",[123] a characterization which persists today.[118]\n",
      "\n",
      "Duncan himself commented on his \"boring\" image, stating: \"If you show excitement, then you also may show disappointment or frustration. If your opponent picks up on this frustration, you are at a disadvantage.\"[124] Sports journalist Kevin Kernan commented on his ability to relax and stay focused, stating that having a degree in psychology, Duncan often not only outplays, but out-psychs his opponents.[125] Duncan has also stated that he especially likes his bank shot, saying: \"It is just easy for me. It just feels good.\"[126] Additionally, Duncan's close and longstanding relationship with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has been described as \"the greatest love story in sports\".[127]\n",
      "\n",
      "In his basketball career, Duncan collected a number of individual and team honors, including being a two-time MVP (2002, 2003), five-time NBA champion (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014) and three-time NBA Finals MVP (1999, 2003, 2005). As a college player, he was honored by the House of Representatives,[128] named the ACC Male Athlete of the Year, won the John R. Wooden Award and Adolph Rupp Trophy, and was selected as the Naismith College Player of the Year in addition to player of the year honors from the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and Sporting News (all 1997).[14] In 2002, Duncan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[129] In his debut year in the NBA (1998), he was voted Rookie of the Year and elected into the All-Rookie Team. He has been named to 15 NBA All-Star Teams (1997–98; 1999–2000 to 2010–11; 2012–13 and 2014–15), 15 All-NBA Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10, 2012–13, 2014–15; ten First Team nominations), and 15 All-Defensive Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10; 2012–13, 2014–15; eight First Team nominations).[3] With these impressive performances, Duncan is one of only four players to receive All-NBA First Team honors in each of his first eight seasons (1998–2005), along with Hall of Famers Bob Pettit (ten seasons), Larry Bird (nine seasons), and Oscar Robertson (nine seasons), and is the only player in NBA history to receive All-NBA and All-Defensive honors in his first 13 seasons (1997–98 to 2009–10).[130]\n",
      "\n",
      "Duncan was also named by the Association for Professional Basketball Research as one of \"100 Greatest Professional Basketball Players of The 20th Century\", the youngest player on that list.[131] In the 2001–02 season, he won the IBM Player Award[132] and The Sporting News (TSN) MVP Award,[133] becoming the third player to ever win the NBA MVP, IBM Player and TSN Player Awards in the same season. On February 18, 2006, he was named one of the Next 10 Greatest Players on the tenth anniversary of the release of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team by the TNT broadcasting crew.[134] In 2009, Duncan was ranked 8th by Slam Magazine in their list of the Top 50 NBA players of All Time,[135] while Sports Illustrated named him its NBA Player of the Decade.[136]\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 4, 2020, it was announced that Duncan would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 29.[137][138]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, Duncan opened the vehicle customization BlackJack Speed Shop in San Antonio, Texas, located near the San Antonio Spurs practice facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August 2017, BlackJack Speed Shop, in partnership with The Tim Duncan Foundation, organized urgently needed supplies for victims of Hurricane Harvey.[139]\n",
      "\n",
      "Duncan married Amy Sherrill in July 2001[11] and the couple had their first child, daughter Sydney, in the summer of 2005.[11] They had a second child, son Draven, in the summer of 2007.[11] The Duncans divorced in August 2013.[140]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, Duncan and longtime girlfriend Vanessa Macias welcomed a child, Quill Duncan.[141]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2001,[142] Duncan established the Tim Duncan Foundation to fund programs involving health awareness and research, education, and youth sports and recreation in San Antonio, Winston-Salem, and the United States Virgin Islands.[11] The foundation's major events have included the Tim Duncan Bowling for Dollar$ Charity Bowl-A-Thon and the Slam Duncan Charity Golf Classic.[11] Between 2001 and 2002, the foundation raised more than $350,000 for breast and prostate cancer research.[15] In those two years, Duncan was named by Sporting News as one of the \"Good Guys\" in sports.[15] Duncan has also supported the Children's Bereavement Center, the Children's Center of San Antonio and the Cancer Therapy and Research Center.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "Duncan cites his late mother as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught him and his sisters the nursery rhyme \"Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest / Until your Good is Better, and your Better is your Best,\" which he adopted as his personal motto.[9] On and off the court, he believes that the three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie.[9] The Spurs captain has also stated that he chose No. 21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law's college number, since he was Duncan's main basketball inspiration, and cites Hall-of-Fame Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson as his childhood idol.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Duncan was honored with the Virgin Islands Medal of Honor, the highest award bestowed by the Virgin Islands territorial government, and has been celebrated in several \"Tim Duncan Day\" ceremonies.[143] In 2000, Legislature of the Virgin Islands President Vargrave Richards said, \"He is a quiet giant. His laid-back attitude is the embodiment of the people of St. Croix, doing things without fanfare and hoopla.\"[143]\n",
      "\n",
      "Duncan enjoys Renaissance fairs and the fantasy role playing game Dungeons & Dragons.[144]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015, Duncan sued his former investment advisor, claiming over $20 million in losses.[145] In September 2016, a federal grand jury indicted the adviser on two counts of wire fraud related to the case.[145] In April 2017, the adviser pled guilty to wire fraud in the case;[146] in June 2018, he reached a settlement and received $7.5 million.[147]\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2020, Duncan offered to pay for airline tickets for college students in the U.S. Virgin Islands to travel home during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.[148]\n",
